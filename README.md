This project consist of implementing Naives Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, MLP, and CNN models 
to train and predict our datasheet CIFAR-10 
(500 images from each class for trainning, and for testing 100 images for each class)


There is 3 python main file

project.py : Contains the Bayes Naives and the Decision Tree main implementation
             uncomment the one you want and run the python file

MLPmain.py : Contains the main implementation of MLP, and run the python file

CNNMain.py : Contains the main implementationf of CNN, two models were initialized, 
            orginal and less layer, uncomment the one you want to run 

Main implementation meaning: DataSheet Extraction and Handling, with training and prediction


Ensure to have dowloaded the following libraries: 
-Pytrorch
-Numpy
-scikitlearn
-matplotlib
-seaborn
